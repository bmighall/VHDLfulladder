# VHDL Full Adder (Artix-7 family Nexys 4 FPGA)
Creator: Ben Mighall

This is the implementation of a simple full-adder circuit using two LEDs (1 and 0) and three switches (2, 1, and 0). LED 1 serves as the Carry Out (2's) bit and LED 0 serves as the 1's bit.

The following code was written as part of coursework for University of Mississippi class EL E 386 (Advanced Digital Systems Lab), and using an Artix-7 family Nexys 4 FPGA board. Constraints file is included in this repository.
